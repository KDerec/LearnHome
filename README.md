<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
### ðŸŒ± Developed skills
- Manage a project with **agile methodologies**.
- Define the **functional requirements** of the application from the customer's needs.
- **Prototype** a **technical solution** for a customer with **domain models** and **wireframes**.

### ðŸ“– Scenario
I am employed at **Dev4U**, a digital services company with two software development entities: 
- one entity specialized in mobile application development ;
- one dedicated to the **web**.  

I am the **lead developer** of the web entity and I receive a **message** from my manager with **good news**...  

ðŸ“¬ -> "I have a project for you ! **Learn@Home** is an association that connects children in school difficulties with volunteer tutors. Basically, their **goal** is to allow any student, anywhere, to have access to distance learning support. They confirmed that they wanted to work with us on their **website project**. ðŸ’ªðŸŽ‰"

The website will make it easier for their students and volunteers to **communicate** directly from their site. Up until then they were mostly using WhatsApp and SMS!
### ðŸš§ðŸš€ Project goal & deliverable
Our first step is to clearly **define the customer needs**, before starting the pure software development.  
We have scheduled another meeting in a few weeks, **the objective** is that you present them with the following elements: 

- [Use case diagrams](https://github.com/KDerec/LearnHome/blob/main/use_case_diagram.pdf) for each of the major **functionalities** of each page (login, chat, calendar, task manager, dashboard).
- [User stories](https://github.com/KDerec/LearnHome/blob/main/user_stories.pdf) with **acceptance criteria** for each feature.
- [Mobile and desktop wireframes](https://github.com/KDerec/LearnHome/tree/main/wireframes) of the site.
- A [kanban board](https://trello.com/b/aKV0xURc/learnhome) breaking down the project, in a **macro way** (excluding technical details) into blocks of features and sub-features for development.
